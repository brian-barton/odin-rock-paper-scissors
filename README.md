# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project's foundations course.

In this project I will be creating a Rock Paper Scissors game with a total of five rounds, using JavaScript. It will be played from the console against the computer. There will be a prompt dialog box, where the player will enter their selection of either 'Rock, 'Paper', or 'Scissors' The computer will then return randomly 'Rock, 'Paper', or 'Scissors'. Depending on the selections of the two players there will be a console message stating which one won the round.

A few of the skills I plan to demonstrate are:

    - The creation/use of Variables and Operators
    - The creation/use of Functions
    - Proper use of Data Types and Conditionals
    - Problem solving
    - Debugging using Dev Tools and other methods
